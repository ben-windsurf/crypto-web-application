# Java 8 to 17 Migration - Test Success Criteria

## Automated Testing Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass  
- [ ] Performance tests show no regression
- [ ] Security scans complete successfully
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits

## Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Application starts successfully with Java 17
- [ ] All critical user journeys work:
  - [ ] Frontend loads and displays cryptocurrency data
  - [ ] Backend API endpoints respond correctly
  - [ ] Trading functionality works (create, view, cancel trades)
  - [ ] Portfolio management functions properly
- [ ] Database connectivity verified (H2 in-memory database)
- [ ] External API integrations functional (if any)
- [ ] Logging and monitoring operational

## Performance Validation
- [ ] Startup time measurement: `time java -jar application.jar --spring.profiles.active=test`
- [ ] Memory usage comparison using Java 17 vs Java 8
- [ ] GC performance with Java 17's default G1GC
- [ ] Application response times remain consistent

## Core User Flows to Test
1. **Backend API Testing:**
   - Start backend server with Java 17
   - Test all REST endpoints (/api/trades, /api/cryptocurrencies)
   - Verify H2 console accessibility
   - Check database operations (CRUD for trades)

2. **Frontend Integration Testing:**
   - Open index.html in browser
   - Verify connection to backend API
   - Test real-time cryptocurrency price updates
   - Verify trading interface functionality

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Test invalid trade requests
   - Verify proper error responses
   - Check logging output for any Java 17 compatibility issues

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass without Java 17 compatibility errors
- No performance regression compared to Java 8
- Application functionality remains identical
- No illegal reflective access warnings (or acceptable warnings documented)
- Startup time improved or maintained
